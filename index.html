                <p>My favorite part about Patino is the chill vibes for the most part.
                It's a great place to learn at. 
                Some students can really help this place and know like the true way patino should be.

            <h2>My least favorite part of Advanced Web</h2>
                <p>Patino is great and all.
                But some faculty/staff members are way too particular about the place.
                To be honest, they should'nt even be here if they wanna ruin the whole vibe like that.
